# Principles

Our mission is to advance a decentralised future, making it easy to use for
everyone, regardless of their experience or location in the world.

We want to give developers and designers useful tools to quickly create
decentralised React apps with great baseline usability and code quality.

## People First

The best interfaces are designed around people, not around technology. When
building your interfaces, it’s very useful to try to imagine how someone else -
not yourself - would use your app. Is it easy and understandable? Could it be
easier still? Work on it more until it’s as easy as possible.

User testing your app in 1-1 sessions with people with different backgrounds
also very enlightening. You will quickly see what works and what’s difficult to
use, and how to improve your app.

## Assume Lazy

In nature things tend to optimise to use the least amount of energy possible.
It is usually the same with people - if an app takes significant amount of
effort to use, it won’t get used. If something can be achieved with 2 clicks
instead of 6, that can make a huge difference to people actually bothering to
use it. Try to remove anything that is unneccessary - whether it’s too much
text, extra steps, or visual noise.

## Buidl something people love

The amount of consideration for users, and polish you put into your app will
determine how people feel about your app. Anticipate what people want, and give
it to them ahead of time. Your transitions should not only look sweet but also
help users create a mental map of your navigation. If there’s a moment where a
user could feel unsure, pre-empt it. Choose beautiful typefaces, but also use
hierarchy, size and colour to make your messaging concise and easy to digest.

So let’s get to it! We hope you will find Lorikeet useful to help you build
things which will leave a positive impact on the world.
